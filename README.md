# chat_app_using_socket-and-express
here I have just edited the server side code and added the socket in that. and i have used the room of socket to make the chat happen.



How to use:
1. start the server
2. open localhost in two tabs
3. in 1 tab login through user 1
4. in 2nd tab login throgh user 2
5. try to send message to each other and you will see the output as real chat app.
